# Process Reviews

The exercises / katas within this repository are examples of my approach to programming. 

1. Middle letter
2. Scrabble solve
3. Checkout
4. Echo
5. Bank

The idea is to record your screen and TDD an exercise for 30 minutes while a partner observes to then provide feedback on your approach, using the code rubric. The objective is simply to practice and get feedback to improve your approach to programming.

#### Why I do this

For a number of reasons.

Practicing writing code while under observation helps show me how good my current process is - where do I get stuck, how am I debugging, how's my approach to TDD - and therefore an accelerated way to improve.

Usefully I will get feedback from a pair partner or coach, and a recording to re-watch myself write code.

It's great feedback and confidence-boosting to show yourself you're getting better at programming.

#### How it happens

You’ll pair up and spend 30 mins observing your partner record their screen and TDD an exercise, while you use a rubric to note down what and how they do in order to give them useful feedback.

And then you switch - you’ll record your screen and TDD an exercise for 30 mins while your partner observes to give feedback

#### What you need

It's helpful to bring the following
- pen and paper for any planning you do
- a timer for when you're observing someone write code.
- a set of process cards.

#### Individual review

1. Reflect on your process - decide what part of your process you want to focus on.
2. Find a small exercise, or kata to practice it. (Start really small and simple and then extend from there)
3. Set a timer for 30 mins.
4. Record your screen
5. Program.
6. Review your recorded process, and use rubric to note down where to improve.
7. Repeat.
